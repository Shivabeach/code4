      <p>This page involves itself with "known family connections". That is to say that everyone on this page has a direct known connection to our family and another family. Of the 150 or so connections we have, we will show where these people came from, their relations to us and the time frame in which they lived by their birth date. The localities given are not the birth localities, but where the individual lived at the time of our families connections.</p>

        <p>These two charts indicate how far back we went to connect to our relatives. The 7th Great Grandfather is about 350 years ago(1640-1685). The 6th Great Grandfather is around 315 years ago(1680-1710). Consider the vast number of relatives we have from a 7th GG.</p>
